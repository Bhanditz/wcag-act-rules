# INSTRUCTIONS:
# This format uses YAML to render test cases. For YAML, indentation is
# critical, so be sure to get it right. Every new level, indent 2 new spaces
# If a particular result has more than one test case, use a list, which takes
# an additional indentation, starting with "- |" The pipe "|" character is used
# to indicate that text is multi-line. This is important to render the 
# <pre> elements.

# Lines starting with "#" are comments and will be ignored
