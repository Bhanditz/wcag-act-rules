# INSTRUCTIONS:
# This format uses YAML to render test cases. For YAML, indentation is
# critical, so be sure to get it right. Every new level, indent 2 new spaces
# If a particular result has more than one test case, use a list, which takes
# an additional indentation, starting with "- |" The pipe "|" character is used
# to indicate that text is multi-line. This is important to render the 
# <pre> elements.

# Lines starting with "#" are comments and will be ignored

inapplicables:
  # A list of inapplicable test cases:
  - |
    <h1 foo="bar">
      <pre>  foo  </pre>
    </h1>
  - |
    <h2 foo="bar">
      <pre>  bar  </pre>
    </h2>

testcases:
  # A result with a single test case:
  step-1-pass1: | 
    <h1 foo="bar">
      <pre>  foo  </pre>
    </h1>

  # A result with a list of test cases:
  step-1-fail:
    - |
      <h1 foo="bar">
        <pre>  foo  </pre>
      </h1>
    - |
      <h1 foo="bar">
        <pre>  foo  </pre>
      </h1>

# Test case pages have no content.
