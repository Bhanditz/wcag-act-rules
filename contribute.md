# How to contribute
The [w3c/wcag-act-rules](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-act-rules) repository is used to share, review, and mature contributed ACT Test Rules. ACT Test Rules conform to the [ACT Rules Format specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format/).

The [ACT Task Force](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/) welcomes contributions in multiple ways:

1. [Contribute ACT Test Rules](#contribute-act-test-rules): Submit ACT Test Rules and associated test cases for review and acceptance.
2. [Submit An Issue](#submit-an-issue): Submit an issue if you feel there is a problem with some of the existing work which you wish to discuss. Issues are best used if you do not have a change in mind.
3. [Peer Review](#peer-review): Become a peer reviewer to review and provide feedback on submitted ACT Test Rules.

## Contribute ACT Test Rules
1.	Read and understand the [ACT Review Process](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/wiki/ACT_Review_Process).
2.	Create pull request to propose a new rule or rules:
  * Create a fork of wcag-act-rules repository.
  * Create a branch for your contribution.
  * Create a pull request with proposed ACT Rule(s) and related test cases.
  * If the contribution is to resolve an issue, add a cross reference to the issue number in the pull request.
  * Label *ready for review*.
3.	Discuss issues and concerns during [peer](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/wiki/ACT_Review_Process#Peer_review) review process.
4.	When submitted rules meet [acceptance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/wiki/ACT_Review_Process#Acceptance) criteria, the pull request will be merged.

For help creating a fork, branch and pull request, see Using [GitHub](#using-github).

## Submit An Issue

Before submitting an issue, we ask that you look through existing issues to ensure that there isn't already an issue that addresses this topic, either open or closed. You can find a list of all issues at: [w3c/wcag-act Issues tab](https://github.com/w3c/wcag-act/issues).

For help creating an issue, see [GitHub Help, creating an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

## Peer Review
**Question:** How will we process peer reviews? Will repository owners accept pull requests of new rules and mark them Draft or leave ready for review? And once reviewed and accepted, simply remove the label? Or will we use GitHub review process but then we are limited to those with proper access.

## Participate in the ACT Task Force

The purpose of the Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) effort is to establish and document rules for testing the conformance of web content to accessibility standards, such as WCAG 2.0 and future versions. For details on how to participate in the ACT Task Force, see [How to Comment, Contribute and Participate](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/#contribute). 

## Participate in the Automated WCAG Monitoring Community Group
The Automated WCAG Monitoring community group, founded in 2014, is a W3C community with the focused to develop reliable rules for WCAG testing, both automated and semi-automated. We aim to assist developers of test tools to improve the accuracy and completeness of their tools. For more information on how to participate, visit the [Auto-WCAG Community Group website] (https://auto-wcag.github.io/auto-wcag/).

## Using GitHub

### Create An Account

To contribute work to the ACT Rules repository, you will need a GitHub account. Basic github accounts are free for anyone. To create an account on github, follow the [signup instructions on Github help](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/).

### Submit A Pull Request

A pull request is a request to pull changes that have been made in one place, and merge them into another. Contributors each maintain a local copy, a fork, of the project (the repository). Changes and contributions should be made in a new branch in the user's fork and then sent in as a pull request to the main project. See [GitHub Help] (https://help.github.com/) for more information on forks and branches.

Pull requests labeled *ready for review* will be submitted for peer review by the ACT Task Force, after which, one of three things may happen:

1. If everything is alright, the pull request will be merged and closed.
2. If additional changes are needed, a comment outlining the necessary changes will be added to the pull request. The *author of the pull request* should make the requested changes. This may lead to further discussion and more change requests. We try to keep this as short as possible.
3. If the group feels the pull request is not in line with existing work, the pull request may be declined. A comment will be left outlining the reason the pull request was declined.

## Code Of Conduct

We are committed to maintaining a positive work environment. This commitment calls for a workplace where participants behave according to the [W3C's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).
