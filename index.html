<h1>ACT Rules Overview</h1>

<p>W3C Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules are publicy documented ways for testing the conformance of content to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>. ACT Rules are contributed, developed, and vetted by the community, to support transparency and consensus. They are intended to be used in the development of fully- and semi-automated testing tools, and manual evaluation methodologies for web accessibility.</p>
